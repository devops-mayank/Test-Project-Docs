Introduction to Linux command ‘sudo’
sudo stands for superuser do. In Ubuntu Linux there is not root account configured by default. If users want root account password then they can manually set it up oo can use ‘sudo’. As we all know, Linux in many ways protects users’ computer being used for bad purposes by some nasty people around us. Using sudo is one of those good ways.
sudo command works in conjunction with security policies, default security policy is sudoers and it is configurable via /etc/sudoers file. Its security policies are highly extendable. One can develop and distribute their own policies as plugins.

1) Edit /etc/sudoers file as follows:
	sudo visudo

2) Add below line to allow sudo access to user linuxtechi:

	linuxtechi ALL=(ALL) ALL


Install Sudo on Ubuntu and Debian
	apt install sudo

user wants to update the operating system by passing command – 	
	apt-get update

The above command will give following error-
	apt-get update error

This error is due to not having root privileges to the user ‘sandy’. The root privileges can be required by passing sudo at the very beginning, like below-
	sudo apt-get update

This command will install packages with the root privileges.
	sudo apt-get install {package-name}

This command will remove packages with the root privileges.
	sudo apt-get remove {package-name}

This command will update packages with the root privileges.
	sudo apt-get update {package-name}

The Linux command ‘su’ is used to switch from one account to another. User will be prompted for the password of the user switching to.
	$ su linuxandubuntu
	password:
	linuxandubuntu@sandy:~$

On Debian, Ubuntu and their derivatives, members of the group sudo are granted with sudo access:
	usermod -aG sudo username

By default, sudo will ask you to enter your password again after five minutes of sudo inactivity. You can change the default timeout by editing the sudoers file. Open the file with visudo: 

Set the default timeout by adding the line below, where 10 is the timeout specified in minutes:
	Defaults  timestamp_timeout=10
=======================
ggranth12@instance-sonarq1:~$ sudo -i
root@instance-sonarq1:~# ls
root@instance-sonarq1:~# sudo bash
root@instance-sonarq1:~# sudo passwd root
Enter new UNIX password: 
Retype new UNIX password: 
passwd: password updated successfully
root@instance-sonarq1:~# cd /root
